Dimond Problem Occurs due to multiple inheritance. 
             A
           /   \ 
          B     C 
          \     / 
             D       While making object of D,compiler gives memory to B and C which in turn gives memory to 
                     A(one by B And one By C), and hence Compiler gets Confused As to which memory We are referring 
                     and hence it throws ambiguity error.
